-- Executing script file `scr.ys' --

1. Executing Verilog-2005 frontend.
Parsing SystemVerilog input from `/home/travis/build/SymbiFlow/sv-tests/third_party/tools/yosys/tests/simple/muxtree.v' to AST representation.
Warning: Found one of those horrible `(synopsys|synthesis) full_case' comments.
Yosys does support them but it is recommended to use Verilog `full_case' attributes instead!
Warning: Found one of those horrible `(synopsys|synthesis) parallel_case' comments.
Yosys does support them but it is recommended to use Verilog `parallel_case' attributes instead!
Generating RTLIL representation for module `\usb_tx_phy'.
Note: Assuming pure combinatorial block at /home/travis/build/SymbiFlow/sv-tests/third_party/tools/yosys/tests/simple/muxtree.v:27 in
compliance with IEC 62142(E):2005 / IEEE Std. 1364.1(E):2002. Recommending
use of @* instead of @(...) for better match of synthesis and simulation.
Generating RTLIL representation for module `\default_cases'.
Generating RTLIL representation for module `\select_leaves'.
Successfully finished Verilog frontend.
